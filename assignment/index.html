<!-- If you have any questions, add them in paragraph tags here! -->
    <li> I am extremely confused by what number 16 is even asking. I really struggled seeing that
         question and knowing what to do with it </li>
    <li> I don't get why if you have multiple else if statements, the last else if statement
         is formatted differently with the {} and without the if </li>
    <li> I am not sure how to distinguish between ugly and pretty code when it comes to
         complex if else statements. You can be very blunt with me and just right ugly
         code when you see it.</li>
    <li> I'm not sure if this will come later, but I would love to figure out how to make the
         html websites (probably w CSS) with moving parts like falling snowflakes or flashing lights </li>
    <li> It is easy for me to play with strings and if else statements, but I freeze when it come sto
         manipulating variables in the conditional statments... for example, I really struggled with
         the part 2 assignment,  question 4. </li>
    <li> Not sure why on question 13, it wont let me say if adventurous === true, whenever I add the true part,
         the console on the webpage say "error unexpected token =" </li>
    <i> <li> I butchered the switch statement questions </li> </i>
